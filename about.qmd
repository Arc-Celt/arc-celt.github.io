Hi, I'm Rongze (Archer) Liu, a proud Zhejiang University alumnus where I earned my bachelor's degree. With a background as a Research Study Assistant at ZJU and experience as a Test Development Engineer at Isvision Technology Co., I've built a solid foundation in data science. Now, I'm excited to embark on my Master of Data Science journey at UBC Vancouver. I’m passionate about coding and problem-solving, and I’ve dabbled in Python, C, Go, and SQL. When I'm not diving into data, you'll find me exploring new tech or geeking out over the latest software trends!
